## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We finalized our app idea (ShellPath), agreed on roles and an initial feature set, and completed Milestone 1 docs in the repo. Writing user stories helped clarify the primary user journeys and informed the database relationships we will need (user, tasks, trophies).

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Coordinating schedules to discuss the app concept was a minor friction. We also spent time deciding which features to include initially vs. later (balancing baseline requirements with two custom features). Note: this repo is being completed solo by Faizan Khan; README and planning docs were updated to reflect a single author.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We will need guidance on setting up migrations and seeds for the Postgres DB, and best practices for deploying both server and client to Render. We may also request help wiring the many-to-many join table for trophies and users and validating POST/PATCH request data.
