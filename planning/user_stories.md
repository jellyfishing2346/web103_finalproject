## Draft User Stories

1. As a Guest, I want to view example milestone paths so that I can decide whether to sign up.
2. As a Registered User, I want to create a profile so that my tasks and trophies are saved.
3. As a Registered User, I want to view a preloaded set of milestone tasks so that I have a starter learning path.
4. As a Registered User, I want to add a new task to a milestone so that I can track a personal objective.
5. As a Registered User, I want to edit a task's title or description so that I can correct mistakes or refine the task.
6. As a Registered User, I want to mark tasks as complete so that I can keep track of progress.
7. As a Registered User, I want to delete tasks I no longer need so that my task list stays relevant.
8. As a Registered User, I want to open a modal to add or edit a task without navigating away so that I can stay focused on the current page.
9. As a Registered User, I want to filter tasks by milestone or completion status so that I can focus on what matters now.
10. As a Registered User, I want to visit the Trophy Shop and purchase trophies with points so that I can celebrate milestones.
11. As a Registered User, I want to view my Trophy Case (purchased trophies) so that I can see rewards I earned.
12. As an Admin, I want to reset the database to seeded defaults so that testers can restart with known data.

(More user stories may be added as we refine features during development.)
